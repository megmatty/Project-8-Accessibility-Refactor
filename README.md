# Project-8-Accessibility-Refactor
Treehouse Project 8
----
This is my eigth project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer.

**Project Notes:**
* Validated HTML, CSS validates with limited warnings but no errors. Accessibility validator gave no errors.
* Tested on a Mac with Safari 9.1.1 (11601.6.17), Chrome 51.0.2704.63, Firefox 46.0.1
* Attempted to hit exceeds criteria
  * Aria describedby documentation is a little confusing, but I tried to put it places it made sense.
* Attempted to adjust design to make color contrast appropriate and links distinctive
* Social media icons are "doubled" (img + background css) which looks a little strange to me, but I read that it's a good
  thing for screens when contrast is way up?

**Needs Work, Need to Learn, and Thoughts:**
* There's an endless amount of smallish looking tweaks to accessibility that might not seem like they matter until you
  enable the screen reader or other tools.
* Colors again prove to be challenging for me as I tried to choose new shades that met contrast thresholds
* I felt surprisingly unsure about this project - not quite sure if I "get it" yet and definitely need to read more on how
  accessibility features are implemented in common practice.

~Time to complete: About 3 days, had travel in the middle and hard to say.
